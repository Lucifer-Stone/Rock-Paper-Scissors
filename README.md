# Rock-Paper-Scissors
This project is all about the Rock-Paper-Scissors Game, which I've worked upon using the Python Programming Language with the help of VSCode.

-> The game requires two players in order for the game to proceed. One, being the user as Player1 and other player would be the computer as Player2.

-> The computer generates it's choice (from [Rock Paper, Scissors]) with the help of <ins>random</ins> module and the user types his/her choice in the editor.

-> Depending on both choices, the scoreboard will be evaluated.
